This patch is based on aea567507f24e710f3153a540966dfe823eebba3 . It:
* Fixes some assets not loading correctly (BUG: it's creating a GLTexture on a different thread!)
* Adds more SDL stuff, because I can
* Speeds up some methods on DynamicSoundEffectInstance
* Suppresses some logging information
* Fixes some bad indentation habits >:D
* Makes one internal method public, because it's used somewhere
